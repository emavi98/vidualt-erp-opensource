# Introduction

there are many entrepreneurs, freelancers and small businesses that are tired of throwing their money away with software that do not help them manage the organization of their business, we are going to give them a hand, since they are the ones that drive the economy of any country , let's make this project accessible to anyone who wants to install it and most importantly it helps to contribute to this community that is growing in good faith.

#foundation for growth and scalability
The idea of ​​this software is to make it completely flexible and that practically any company can use it. I am going to dedicate myself entirely to this project and fulfill my goal of helping as many entrepreneurs as possible.

What differentiates this ERP from the others on the market? I will try to ensure that the growth of the app is not based on plugins, that it has a more native operation and that the functionalities that are incorporated are totally flexible and native to the program itself. , which provides a level of security and robustness to the project.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
